Response to Question 1:
The change inside the function call (increment_int_a) changes the variable during the function call. 
However, the changes are not saved after the function call because the function call takes in variables, but does not have the access to the actual values.

Response to Question 2:
The change inside increment_int_b changes the variable during and after the function call. 
The changes made to the variable after the function call remains because the variable, a list, was passed in by refrence.

Response to Question 3: 
When we pass in a list or dictionary into a function, the changes made to the function call are saved because they are passed in by refrence. 
Unlike integers that are not passed by refrence, so changes are not saved.
